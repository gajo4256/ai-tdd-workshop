# EXERCISE TWO

## STEP 1

- Get your LLM to help you summarise everything you’ve discussed so far, about what you’re building and how you want it to function
- Persist the results – eg in a file called `project_spec.md`

## STEP 2

- Start again from scratch! 
- Delete everything except `project_spec.md` (or equivalent)
- Start a brand new chat window. Try a different LLM if you can!
- Tell the LLM you want to proceed using TDD (test driven development)
- Ask it to read and follow instructions in `testing_process.md` and `running-scripts.md` or any other process files from the `process-files` folder.
- Remember [the golden rules](https://publish.obsidian.md/clare-sudbery-questions/Current+Project+Notes/0+-+Missions/09-AI-Mission/LLM+Golden+Rules).
